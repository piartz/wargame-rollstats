# Wargame Rollstats

Tool for assisting wargaming and roleplay games with statistics about dice rolling. 

## Information

The tool is intended for serving several game systems and dices, such as Warhammer, SAGA, D&D or any other system that uses regular dices and success/failures based on thresholds (notation such as 3+, 5+, with positive or negative modifiers...). 

Since this is a simple mathematical based library, it can be easily translated to other languages (see a [Java version](https://github.com/piartz/saga-companion/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/piartz/sagacompanion/WargameStats.java) of this tool for my project [Saga Companion](https://github.com/piartz/saga-companion)).

## Can I use your code on my own app?

Yes, as long as it respects GPLv3 (see `LICENSE` for more information).
