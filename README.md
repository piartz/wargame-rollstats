# Wargame Rollstats

Tool for assisting wargaming and roleplay games with statistics about dice rolling. 

## Information

The tool is intended for serving several game systems and dices, such as Warhammer, SAGA, D&D or any other system that uses regular dices and success/failures based on thresholds (notation such as 3+, 5+, with positive or negative modifiers...). 

## Why yet another tool like this? Why C?

This is intended to help me exercise my C skills with a project based on my hobbies. Probably the code will look horrible at first -sorry about that. 

## Can I use your code on my own app?

Yes, as long as it respects GPLv3 (see `LICENSE` for more information).
